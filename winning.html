                        <p>My brother, Vincent, got a chessboard for Christmas that year from the First Chinese Baptist Church. At first, my mother wanted him to throw it out, saying that she didn’t want it, neither would we. However, as soon as we got home, we were fighting to see the beat-up instruction manual.</p>
                        <p>As older brothers go, they do not like sharing anything with their little sisters. I watched them play all Christmas week. </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"The chessboard seemed to hold elaborate secrets waiting to be untangled"(Tan 94).</blockquote>
                        <p>They only let me play after I offered them two lifesavers for the two missing pawns. My brothers taught me all the rules of chess how a pawn can only move two spaces upon its first turn, then one space, being only able to take diagonally. I got the hang of it quickly. Not long after that, I beat him, which is still a sour topic for us today. </p>
                        <p>After Christmas, I went to the library after school to check out books about chess. Chess seemed so natural to me. The way the pieces moved and the satisfaction of seeing my opponent’s dissatisfaction after taking one of their pieces. There was a kind old man, Lau Po, I called him, and I would spend my afternoons playing chess with him. Even though I would beat him every time, Lau Po would keep playing with me. He never used the same tactics twice. </p>
                        <p>Sometimes, a crowd would form around us. Once, a man watching us play told my mother that I should join a chess tournament, as that would help me recognize my true potential. I was skeptical, I knew they would have American rules, and if I lost, I would bring shame to my family.</p>
                        <p>I ultimately took that chance, so two weeks later, I was sitting on the bleachers with my mom in a dimly lit gym in Oakland, waiting for my name to be called. I was so nervous. All of my opponents were so much older than me. I was only eight at the time. My legs could not stop shaking; my breaths were shallow. My name was called over the loudspeaker. My mother handed me a chang, a little piece of jade, red, glowing like the light from the sun. “For good luck,” she said.</p>
                        <p>I looked at my opponent. He was a teenager, fifteen, from Oakland. He smiled and reached out to shake my hand. My palms were sweaty, and I reluctantly shook his big hands. We sat down and started playing. To this day, I can still remember the look in his eyes after the 3rd move, in which I pushed out with my bishop and took his knight. After 17 turns, I saw my chance. I took his castle with my queen, flipped the clock, and said, “Checkmate.”</p>

                        <p>The crowd cheered and clapped. I had almost forgotten that they were there. I looked at my mother, who had a smile on her face and gave me a nod of approval.</p>
                        <p>Later that night, my mom cooked me a meal with my favorite dishes and bought me a treat from the downstairs bakery, where she put my trophy in the case facing the street. The sense of pride and accomplishment was overwhelming for my eight-year-old heart. To this day, I remember every move I made to bring home the victory that day. </p>

                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>Would I be sitting here at my desk, looking out my window on the 47th floor, listening to calls ringing all day? Would I have proven Bobby Fischer wrong? More importantly, would my mother and I still be on good terms? </p>
                        <p>These are the things I ponder endlessly about. After I shouted at her on Stockton Street, she stopped bragging about me to everyone, and in fact, stopped talking to me as a whole. This went on for a few days, with me sitting in my room, staring at the sixty-four squares on my chessboard. </p>
                        <p>Looking at those squares, I decided I was going to quit playing chess. Obviously, I was not going to quit quit; I just wanted some attention from my mother. Later that night, instead of my typical practice session for chess, I made my way into the living room and plopped myself on the couch in front of the TV with my brothers. </p>
                        <p>I planned to ditch the tournament next week, so my mother would have to talk to me about it. My sponsors have been nonstop calling her, begging her to make me play again. My mother eventually came to me, literally crying, “Why are you not playing chess”(Tan 188)? </p>
                        <p>I remember the feeling of guilt and remorse when I answered, as I knew that the boy I had beaten twice before had won this tournament. I knew I loved this game, but I wanted to show my mother that I was not a pawn in her game. I told her I would start playing chess again. </p>
                        <p>I expected her to smile, give me a big hug, then ask me what I wanted to eat later that night, but she just frowned and stood there, not looking away. Then she said something that I remember seamlessly, word for word.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“You think it is so easy. One day quit, next day play. Everything for you is this way, so easy, so fast”(Tan 189).</blockquote>
                        <p>I was stunned at what she said. Was she right? Did she just beat me? No, I can’t let her win. What she said was wrong. That night, a fever miraculously took me over, and she was back to her scolding for not wearing enough to school. The following day, she was making porridge and spoon-feeding me on my bed. I was satisfied; everything went back to normal with my mother.</p>
                        <p>Except nothing went back to normal. My mother did not hover over me when I practiced chess anymore. She did not polish my trophies every night anymore. She no longer cut out any more sections of newspapers that had my name in them.
                        </p>
                        <p>I won all of my games in the next tournament; however, my points were not enough. I lost my first tournament. What was worse than feeling the horrible feeling of losing was seeing my mother walk silently, with a satisfied look on her face, as if she had planned this loss from the beginning. </p>
                        <p>After that, I felt the game of chess slowly starting to leave me. It felt as I had lost my armor, leaving me vulnerable to everyone playing me. Over the next few weeks, I kept on playing, but I didn’t feel the confidence or nostalgia of playing chess anymore. My gift, my prodigal skill, was slowly dying. </p>
                        <p>And after I lost twice to the boy I was able to beat a few years ago with ease, I quit. And to this day, no one has questioned me ever since.</p>

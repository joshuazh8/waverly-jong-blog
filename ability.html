                        <p>There are small and precise details that stand out to me, and I can pinpoint them and save them in my memory. I remember each name of every chess opening on each page of Advanced Chess Openings. I remember the taste of that delicious cake the bakery downstairs made for me after I won my second tournament.</p>
                        <p>At school, when the teacher was beginning to teach us the times table. I remember taking one glance at it and being able to recite it from the heart. The teacher was impressed. </p>
                        <p>Over the years, through college, I was able to memorize content with ease. And I still remember to this day: periodic table, calculus formulas, advanced engineering. Heck, I can even remember my tax returns from 5 years ago. </p>
                        <p>I put most of my success in Chess in my memory. As I played each game, I could remember every single move every one of my opponents took. However good my memory is, I can not remember the number of times I remembered a strategy from the book I just read and executed it, leading to my victory.</p>
                        <p>To this day, I am not sure if my memory is a curse or a gift. I remember every fight I have had with my brother, my parents, and Jing-Mei. I remember the time when I got lost in a supermarket when I was 7. I could still feel the fear, the feeling of loneliness I felt. </p>
                        <p>I remember the time when I was ten. Mother would take me to the market on Saturdays when there was not a tournament. She would walk around all the shops, buying almost nothing, to go there just to show me off. Show me off like I was one of the trophies in the trophy case downstairs. Show me off like I am some kind of sacred animal. I felt like the only reason my mother wanted to spend time with me outside was for her to show me off to the world. I hated it.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, I would try to forget these things. The more I tried, the more they embedded themselves into my memory. I would be sitting at my desk on the top floor of the office building, and when a phone rang, I would have a flashback to the time when the school called my parents to let them know that Vincent was caught trying to cheat on his math test. I stayed in my room all evening with a pillow over my ears, still hearing the faint thud sounds, yelps from the other room. </p>
